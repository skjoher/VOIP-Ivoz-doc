The hunt groups allows configuring more complex *ringing* process that the
traditional **call to a user**.

These are the fields shown for new hunt groups:

    Name

    Description
        Additional information

    Strategy
        Describes how will the calls be delivered. See details in glossary below.

    Ring all timeout
        For *Ringall* strategy, defines for how long will the members be called.

    Prevent missed calls
        When 'Yes', calls will never generate a missed call. When 'No', missed calls will be prevented only for RingAll
        hunt groups if someone answers.

    No answer configuration
        Policy when hunt group members do not answer the call after defined timeouts.

.. tip:: When configuring a hunt group, you can prevent missed calls on called members with **Prevent missed calls** setting:

    - **Yes**: calls generated by the hunt group will never generate missed calls on called members.

    - **No**: The behaviour of this setting depends on the hunt group type:

    - **RingAll**: calls generated by the hunt group will generate missed calls on called members only if none of them answers the call.

    - **Remaining types**: calls generated by the hunt group will generate missed calls on every called member that does not answer the call.

There are 4 strategies available:

.. glossary::

    Ringall
        The call will make all the terminals of the group during a predefined 
        time.

    Linear
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a predefined order
        ringing during the configured time. If the call is not answered by any 
        user of the group, it will be hung up (or will trigger the no answer logic).

    Round robin
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a predefined order 
        ringing during the configured time. If the call is not answered by any
        user of the group, the call will *jump* again to the first member of the 
        group and keep looping.  

    Random
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a random order, 
        ringing during the configured time.  If the call is not answered by any 
        user of the group, it will be hung up (or will trigger the no answer logic).


Adding members to hunt group
============================

**List of users** subsection allows adding users to each group:

- For *RingAll hunt groups*, users will be added without any additional parameters.

- For remaining groups, priority and timeout will be specified for each member. Priority determines the order, timeout ring
  duration for each member.

Section :ref:`Users` also allows adding member to existing hunt groups using **List of hunt groups** option.
